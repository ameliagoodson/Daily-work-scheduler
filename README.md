# Daily work scheduler

Deployed application found here: https://ameliagoodson.github.io/Daily-work-scheduler/

This daily planner displays the current day and date at the top of the scheduler, which is updated dynamically via the use of the moment.js framework.

The planner features timeblocks for standard business hours between 9am and 5pm. The hourly blocks change colour based on the time of day: past hours are coloured dark grey, the current hour is displayed as red, and future hours are shaded green.

Users can enter the details of their schedule in the planner and press the 'save' button, which saves the information to local storage and remains constant upon page refresh.
